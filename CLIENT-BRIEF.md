## Problem Description

1. **Inefficient Work process of Fundraisers**

BC Cancer faces a significant challenge in automating the selection of donors for events.

Currently, fundraisers must manually track and manage donor information, repeating this time-consuming process for every event.

2. **Low quality communication between Coordinator and fundraisers**

Manual method results in poor communication and coordination between the fundraisers and coordinators. Coordinators have to manage fundraisers manually.

3. **Data Overload, But Lack of Usable Insights**

Bruce Davidson, a member of the IT department, has described the organization as being “data rich, but information poor.” While the organization has access to vast amounts of data, it struggles to effectively process and extract meaningful insights from it.
